                <p>While we strive to ensure the smooth functioning of our platform and uphold the highest standards of service, it is important to note the following:

                  Blood Bag Delivery Service: We serve as a logistical service provider, connecting blood banks with healthcare facilities for the transportation of blood bags. Our role is strictly limited to facilitating the delivery process and does not extend to the handling, storage, or quality control of the blood products themselves.
                  
                  Limited Liability: We expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for any issues, including but not limited to spillage, damage, contamination, infection, or adverse reactions related to the blood products being transported. Any such incidents or concerns arising from the blood itself are the sole responsibility of the individual blood bank providers.
                  
                  Public Health: While we are committed to promoting public health and safety through our services, it is important to recognize that the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the safety, quality, and suitability of blood products lies with the respective blood bank providers. We do not assume any responsibility for public health matters related to blood donation, collection, storage, or transfusion.
                  
                  Compliance with Regulations: We adhere to all relevant regulations and standards governing the transportation and handling of blood products. However, compliance with regulatory requirements and adherence to best practices in blood banking and transfusion remain the responsibility of the participating blood banks and healthcare facilities.
                  
                  By using the Blood Bag Delivery System, all users, including blood banks, healthcare facilities, and delivery personnel, acknowledge and accept the terms of this disclaimer. We encourage users to exercise diligence and adhere to established protocols and guidelines to ensure the safe and effective delivery of blood products.
                  
                  <br>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all representations, warranties and
                    conditions relating to our website and the use of this website. Nothing in this disclaimer will:</p>

                    <li>limit or exclude our or your liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;</li>

                </ul>
